Bishop and First&nbsp;Lady Williams, Founders of Faith Cornerstone, Suffolk VA, were very important to Mother Joyner.&nbsp; She would spend hours talking to First&nbsp;Lady Williams on the phone.&nbsp; They were like sisters.&nbsp; Both Bishop and First&nbsp;Lady pre-deceased Mother Joyner.&nbsp; After their death, Mother Joyner developed a beautiful relationship with their daughter Sister Lilly she called her.&nbsp; Sister Lilly would have dinner at Mother Joyner’s house almost every Sunday.&nbsp;She loved to bake specialty cakes and share her home cook meals with family and friends. Naomi&nbsp;also made the best sweet potato pies, biscuits, and fried chicken.&nbsp; During the holidays,&nbsp;Naomi&nbsp;would bake up to 20 pies to give whole pies away to family and friends.&nbsp;Often times, Naomi&nbsp;would cook&nbsp;numerous&nbsp;cakes, donate them to her church. &nbsp;&nbsp;She believed in family gathering on Sundays, holidays and special events. When her family came together, and it was often, her home was full, loud, and had standing room only.&nbsp; She would ensure all who wanted to be part of the special event were there.&nbsp;&nbsp;Naomi&nbsp;would spend hours on the phone calling everyone to get the word out to come over.&nbsp; It was magical.&nbsp; Just the way she liked it.&nbsp; Her sisters and brothers from South Carolina, North Carolina and New York, often times would come on holidays and other special occasions.&nbsp; She would many times travel to South Carolina to be part of the annual family reunion.&nbsp;Naomi&nbsp;would also spend hours on the phone with her best friend she met while working at Maryview Hospital.&nbsp;

(Mark 10:51).&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the burden another carried and offered to help with the load.&nbsp; &nbsp;That was the spirit of&nbsp;Naomi!</p><p>Now this beautiful servant, can rest!&nbsp;&nbsp;Well done, thou good and faithful servant.&nbsp;&nbsp;You have finished the course&nbsp;and kept the faith!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enter the gates of heaven where there is a place Jesus has prepared for you!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillam%2FsLzOpaCtmZ6bwq%2Bx0ZqjrJ2iq7aksY2cpqZnnZq6sL7ImqNopZ%2Bptaa%2BjKeYqKWZYrWiucilq6imXZ%2B8urrEq2Y%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;
