As Graham Elliot, he is widely known for his Chicago restaurants Graham Elliot and Grahamwich as well as for his appearances as a judge in the American version of the culinary reality TV show MasterChef.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how much wealth this talented culinary genius has accumulated? According to sources, it is estimated that Graham Elliot’s net worth as of early 2016, is $1.5 billion, acquired through his chef’s career in numerous restaurants, now spanning over 20 years.</p><h3>Graham Elliot Net Worth $1.5 Million</h3><p>Before settling down in Chicago, Illinois, Graham Elliot was raised in different parts of the world, as his parents were in the US Navy. He dropped out of high school, and at the age of 18 worked as a busboy and dishwasher. Upon entering the food business, he decided to pursue a cooking career and immediately after graduating from culinary school at Jonson & Wales University in Providence,&nbsp;Rhode Island, Graham started his professional career at the five-star restaurant, Mansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas, Texas. Afterwards, he transferred to The Jackson House Inn & Restaurant in Woodstock, Vermont where he was named as one of the Best New Chefs in 2004 by the Food & Wine Magazine. These engagements provided the basis for Graham Elliot’s net worth.</p><p>Subsequently, he moved to Chicago’s TRU, and under another famous chef, <a href=#>Charlie Trotter</a>, at the age of 27 he was named as the youngest four-star chef in the USA. Elliot later worked as master chef of Avenues at The Peninsula Hotel, and brought the restaurant its prestigious four-star rating. All these involvements have certainly increased Graham Elliot’s overall net worth.</p><p>In 2008, Graham Elliot opened his first, eponymous, “bistronomic” restaurant, which is now among only 15 restaurants in the USA that have been awarded two Michelin stars. Two years later, he opened Grahamwich, his second restaurant. Chicago’s West Loop Graham Elliot Bistro was opened in 2012, the same year that Graham Elliot was named Chef of the Year and was inducted into Chicago Chefs Hall of Fame – city major, <a href=#>Rahm Emanuel</a>, proclaimed 19th September as “Graham Elliot Day”. It is doubtless that these accomplishments positively impacted the total amount of Graham Elliot’s wealth.</p><p>Apart from cooking, Graham is also a singer and a guitarist. His interest in music has led him to become the Culinary Director of Lollapalooza, a three day music festival, during which he cooks backstage for the bands, and oversees the festival’s food offerings.</p><p>Graham Elliot’s TV career began in 2010, when he became a judge on the American version reality cooking shown “MasterChef”, alongside <a href=#>Gordon Ramsay</a> and <a href=#>Joe Bastianich</a>. In the period between 2013 and 2015, he also served as the judge for the TV cooking competition series, “MasterChef Junior”. Some of Graham Elliot’s most recent activities include the position of the head judge of “Cooks vs. Cons”, Food Network’s cooking competition hosted by <a href=#>Geoffrey Zakarian</a>. Besides raising his popularity, Graham’s television performances have added a significant sum to his net worth.</p><p>In his career so far, Graham Elliot has been nominated three times for the James Beard Award, an annual award for excellence in cuisine, and was honored with numerous privileges including cooking for the president <a href=#>Barack Obama</a> in 2010, for his 49th birthday.</p><p>When it comes to his personal life, Graham Elliot is married to Allie, his business partner and the mother of his two sons. However, Graham has another son from his previous marriage. With his family, Graham Elliot currently resides in Chicago.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=16.779279279279><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Graham Elliot</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$1.5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>January 4, 1977</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Seattle, Washington, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6 ft 2 in (1.89 m)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Profession</td><td>Chef, restaurateur and reality television personality</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Jonson & Wales University in Providence, Rhode Island</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Allie Elliot</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Children</td><td>Jedediah Lindsay Elliot, Conrad Elliot, Mylo Elliot</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Kate Tippett-Bowles, John Bowles</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Graham Elliot Bowles</td></tr><tr readability=0.30769230769231><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/OfficialGrahamElliot</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.33333333333333><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/grahamelliot</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.39130434782609><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.instagram.com/grahamelliot</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm3863374</a></td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Awards</td><td>"Michelin stars" (Chicago Tribune, Chicago Sun-Times), Chicago Chefs Hall of Fame, James Beard Award</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Nominations</td><td>Best New Chefs (2004, Food & Wine Magazine),"Graham Elliot Day" (19th Ceptember, Chicago)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>TV Shows</td><td>"MasterChef", "MasterChef Junior", “Cooks vs. Cons”</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=3.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=3><td>1</td><td>Chef/owner, "Grahamwich" in Chicago.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>2</td><td>According to his publicist, he changed his name professionally "after a lifetime of confusion and typos" from 'Graham Elliot Bowles' to just 'Graham Elliot' [2010].</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Actor <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actor><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>The Real O'Neals</td><td>2016</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Graham Elliot</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=6><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>Don't Break Down: A Film About Jawbreaker</td><td>2017</td><td>Documentary</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>MasterChef Junior</td><td>2013-2017</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself -
