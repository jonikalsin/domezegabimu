As of late 2017, based on authoritative sources it is reported to be $300,000 acquired largely from his years appearing in the reality show “Little People, Big World”.</p><h3>Jeremy James Roloff Net Worth $1 Million</h3><p>Born in Hillsboro, Oregon, Roloff is the son of <a href=#>Matthew Roloff</a>, an actor, writer and television personality, and <a href=#>Amy Roloff</a>, also a television personality. He has a twin brother named <a href=#>Zach</a>, and two other siblings named <a href=#>Jacob</a> and <a href=#>Molly</a>.</p><p>In 2006, Roloff and his family shot to fame when their family became the subject of the reality TV show entitled “Little People, Big World”. The show revolved on how his parents, who both have dwarfism, run their day to day lives raising their children and managing their farm house in Oregon, called the Roloff Farm.</p><p>Despite being a television personality at such a young age, <a href=#>Roloff</a> continued pursuing his personal interests and passion. After graduating from high school, he later on attended the local community college in his hometown. Then with his growing passion for photography, <a href=#>Roloff</a> decided to leave Oregon, and attended Brooks Institute of Photography in Southern California to polish his craft.</p><p>The Roloff family’s reality television show certainly helped to increase their net worth, but aside from being TV stars, their farm is also another source of their income. In 1990, his parents bought a 34-acre farmhouse in Helvetia, Oregon to create Roloff Farm. When his parents were able to finish the farmhouse it now includes a pirate ship on a lake, a medieval castle, a three-story house, a mine shaft, a soccer field, a volleyball court, underground tunnels, and a pumpkin farm. They opened the farmhouse to the public and have been visited by many thousands of people since then. Their pumpkins also led them to launch Pumpkin Food Product Business that also helps in their net worth.</p><p>Today, <a href=#>Jeremy Roloff</a> is still appearing along with his family in “Little People, Big World.” He also works as a professional photographer.</p><p>In terms of his personal life, Roloff has been married to Audrey Mirabella Botti since 2014, and together they have a daughter named Ember Jean.</p><p><a href=#>Roloff</a> was also involved in a controversy when an article entitled “A Big Bigot in the Land of the Little People” appeared online on the National Enquirer. The article exposed Roloff and how he was caught making racial and homophobic comments against the LGBT community. His parents have issued an apology since then.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=12.932642487047><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Jeremy Roloff</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$1 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>May 10, 1990</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Oregon, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 10 in (1.78 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Television personality</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Brooks Institute of Photography in Ventura, California</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Audrey Mirabella Botti (m. 2014)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Ember Jean Roloff</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Matthew Roloff, Amy Roloff</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Siblings</td><td>Zachary Roloff, Jacob Roloff, Molly Roloff</td></tr><tr readability=0.32><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/JeremyJamesRoloff</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.35><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/jeremyjroloff</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.375><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/jeremyroloff/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2203837</a></td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Movies</td><td>Little People, Big Dreams (TV Movie documentary, 2005)</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>TV Shows</td><td>Little People, Big World: Wedding Farm (2012), The Oprah Winfrey Show (2003-2008), Little People, Big World (TV Series documentary, 2006-2017)</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=9.4172932330827><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=2.2340425531915><td>1</td><td>Got engaged to <a href=#>Audrey Botti</a> on March 15, 2014.</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>2</td><td>An article about Jeremy Roloff's racist and homophobic comments made on-line appeared in the September 1, 2008 issue of the National Enquirer in an article entitled "A Big Bigot In The Land of the Little People".
