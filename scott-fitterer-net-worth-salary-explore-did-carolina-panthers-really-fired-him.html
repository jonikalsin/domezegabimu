So, <strong>what is his current net worth?</strong> He may have been one of the highest-paid general managers in the NFL since his replacement in Seattle has already reached the list. Scott Patrick Fitterer, born on November 4, 1973, is a football executive with extensive experience.</p><p>Scott is a Seattle, Washington native who has always participated in a variety of sports. He has a history of being a two-sport athlete in college.&nbsp;He excelled in both baseball and football while at UCLA. Fitterer pitched for the Toronto Blue Jays for three seasons.&nbsp;Unfortunately, he was forced to withdraw from the sport owing to pressing shoulder issues. Fitterer started his NFL career as a part-time area scout for the New York Giants in 1998.</p><p>Fitterer was hired as an area scout by the Seattle Seahawks in 2001. Scott was then named co-director of player personnel by the Seahawks.&nbsp;His efforts were rewarded in 2020 when he was promoted to vice president of football operations.&nbsp;Fitterer was appointed general manager of the Carolina Panthers on January 14, 2021.</p><h2>Scott Fitterer Salary & Net Worth in 2024</h2><p><strong>Scott Fitterer’s net worth</strong> is impossible to ascertain since neither he nor the club have published his income. Scott signed a 5-year deal with the Seahawks in 2021, which concluded with him joining the Carolina Panthers.&nbsp;However, when his compensation is compared to that of other NFL general managers, his net worth is projected to be between $3.74 million and $6 million.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Scott-Fitterer-1.jpg alt="Scott Fitterer" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Why? The Seattle Seahawks pay its general manager, John Schneider, $3.75 million a year.&nbsp;Scott joined the Panthers after leaving the Seahawks. As a result, he has joined the Panthers, most likely because they offered him a bigger contract than the Seahawks.&nbsp;Furthermore, Panthers owner David Tepper is one of the NFL’s wealthiest owners right now. He is the 90th wealthiest person in the world, with a net worth of roughly $20.6 billion.&nbsp;Tepper would have spent a lot of money to retain Scott on his squad.&nbsp;Despite the Panthers releasing him early, Scott has greatly boosted his net worth while working with Tepper.</p><h2>Scott Has Been Fired by the Panthers</h2><p>Following the Panthers’ 2-15 record in 2023, owner David Tepper’s charity ran out, and the organization dismissed general manager Scott Fitterer after three seasons.&nbsp;Fitterer, who was named general manager during Matt Rhule’s tenure, had various challenges.&nbsp;Following a 1-10 record, head coach Frank Reich was fired in Week 13.</p><p>In addition, he brokered a high-stakes deal to obtain the first overall selection in the 2024 NFL Draft, which he used to choose Alabama quarterback Bryce Young.&nbsp;The Panthers’ poor performance, however, resulted in the NFL’s poorest record, and they surrendered the first-round pick to the Chicago Bears.&nbsp;Fitterer’s free-agent signings, notably Adam Thielen and DJ Chark, also failed to live up to expectations. Furthermore, his draft choices, notably those in the 2023 class, generated erratic results.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Scott-Fitterer-2.jpg alt="Scott Fitterer" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Scott was dismissed by the Panthers after going 14-37 during his tenure due to coaching and quarterback issues. Despite several successes in free-agent acquisitions, Fitterer’s tenure was hampered by serious shortcomings, causing Tepper to fire him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiqnKekqXqntdOtnKudomK7psCMsKarrJhiwKK4wKuwZp2opbmwvsRmm6KcXZius7vLoqWaZaCWu7W0xKuqZqqVlrmtxYyfoKudlGK1qrmO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WeBlogy - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
