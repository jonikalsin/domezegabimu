Lumpkin, it was stated by Craig Allan, the current director of the Sea Island performance center, to the Brunswick News, “[set] an example for us every day of how we should act as professionals, how we should treat our students.” Brannen Veal, the director of golf at Sea Island, issued a statement in which he referred to Lumpkin as “the consummate gentleman and golf professional.”</p><p>On Friday, the family will welcome guests at the St. Simons Methodist Church located at 624 Ocean Boulevard from 10:00 to 11:00 a.m., immediately followed by the funeral ceremony at 11:00 a.m. On St. Simons Island, where Lumpkin resided, he passed away last week at the age of 86. During his 33 years of service at Sea Island, he assisted Davis Love Jr. in developing the prototype for a golf performance center that has now been replicated all over the world. This facility combines instruction, fitness, and swing analysis.</p><p>The death of Jack Lumpkin has occurred. After Davis Love III’s father, who had been Davis Love III’s primary instructor, passed away in 1988, Jack Lumpkin became Davis Love III’s primary instructor and helped develop the Sea Island Golf Performance Center one of the best golf instruction facilities in the world. Davis Love III is a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame and has won the Players championship twice. Jack Lumpkin, a well-known golf instructor, has passed away at the age of 86, according to The Seaside Headmaster.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwtsCcomakpaK9rLXNZqaboaSqrrPFjJpksJ2coXqsus6wpWafn6GzbsDEmpqhnaJisaqx0maYrWWRnLJuhJVo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WeBlogy - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
