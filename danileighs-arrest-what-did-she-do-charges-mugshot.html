Charges &amp;amp; Mugshot</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p><strong>A well-known artist by the name of DaniLeigh, also known as Danielle Leigh Curie, was just detained on May 30, 2023, on suspicion of DUI.</strong></p><p>She was accused of fleeing the scene of a serious collision, operating a vehicle while intoxicated, and endangering people or property. The mugshot of DaniLeigh has gained a lot of attention on social media.</p><p>After a hit-and-run incident in Miami Beach, Florida, she was taken into custody early in the morning. The alleged victim was riding a moped when she suffered severe back injuries. She arrived at the Miami-Dade Corrections & Rehabilitation facility at 8:16 in the morning and was released at 11:45 on a bail of $9,500. The artist’s representatives have yet to react on the arrest.</p><h2>When DaniLeigh hit the motorcycle, she was operating a Mercedes-Benz</h2><p>People reports that DaniLeigh was detained on Tuesday after being seen operating a Mercedes-Benz at an excessive rate of speed that struck a motorcycle. A witness claimed that the moped was being pulled behind the car, and that although onlookers tried to warn the driver to halt, she would not budge.</p><p>Eventually, the officers were able to stop the car, but a strong odor of alcohol was coming from it, and they were able to find a bottle of tequila. When Danielle was approached by the police, she claimed that her license’s name was Danielle Curiel and denied hitting anyone. The car was eventually towed.</p><p>The 28-year-old was asked to perform a field sobriety test, and when he refused, he was taken into custody. She underwent two breath tests, the first of which revealed a breath alcohol level of 0.145 and the second of which revealed a level of 0.148. The moped’s rider suffered a spine fracture and kidney laceration and was immediately taken to a hospital. The moped was substantially damaged, and the man suffered non-life-threatening injuries, according to the police affidavit.</p><h2>DaniLeigh was detained in 2021 on suspicion of assault</h2><p>In November 2021, police were called in response to a domestic abuse report made by DaBaby, the daughter of DaniLeigh’s father. Police instructed DaBaby to investigate the allegations on his own, but the following day, he called them. But this time, the police had sufficient proof to detain DaniLeigh, who was then charged with two counts of simple assault.</p><p>The music video for Prince’s song Breakfast Can Wait was directed by Danielle. She then released her debut EP, Summer with Friends, along with two tracks, Play and D.O.S.E. The Plan, My Present, Movie, and In My Feelings are just a few of the songs that Danielle went on to record in the future.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Taylor Kitsch Doesn&#39;t Have Time To Date Or Wed"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/taylor-kitsch-doesnt-have-time-to-date-or-wed/"}{"1":57}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Taylor Kitsch Doesn’t Have Time To Date Or Wed</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Artist</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Miles Edmund Cotman</a></h3>Miles Edmund Cotman estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
