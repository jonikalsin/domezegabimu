You might say they have the moral backbone of a chocolate eclair. This is a tweet about John Mulaney.</p><p>— adele castro (@chameleonghosts) <a href=#>May 21, 2022</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr xml:lang=en>Pretty disappointed in John Mulaney, saw him tonight and yeah, he was funny, but he gave Dave Chapelle the platform to make some transphobic jokes. Also very disheartening to hear a crowd of 12,000 around you (a trans person) laughing at transphobic jokes.
