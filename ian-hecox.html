He started an online blog to find someone who would date him, but every single one of the 30,698 votes declined. However, in the episode “5 Ways to Get a Girl,” he got attracted by a girl who was sympathetic to him crying, but she was never seen again.</p><p>In “His First Girlfriend,” he and Antoinette plan a wedding, but Anthony’s hypnotism makes him lose his sentence, thus resulting in Antoinette breaking up with him. In “The Famous Cheese Guy,” Anthony took a picture with a girl who enjoyed his cheese Melt-Down commercial, but when he moved in, the girl pushed him away and then spit on him.</p><p>His sexuality varies as well. In the episode “Smosh Snatchers,” Anthony claims that the only guy he would go gay for is McGyver, but he states that he thinks every guy would go gay for McGyver. In “EVIL FORTUNE COOKIE!”, he is given a fortune that says he and Anthony get married, so he asks Anthony to marry him. A disgusted Anthony refuses, telling him that he needs help, and walks away; in response, he starts crying and yells to Anthony that he would have divorced him anyway.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-79978 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ian-Hecox-vox.jpg alt="Ian Hecox" width=650 height=433 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-79978 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Ian Hecox and Anthony while speaking on the stage.
