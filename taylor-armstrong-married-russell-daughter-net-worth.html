Who Is She Married To Now?</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p><span>Taylor Armstrong is an American television personal</span><span>ity, best known for her appearance in the show The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.&nbsp;</span><span>Aside from her professional career, she had quite a tragic experience in her life while she was with her now-dead husband, Russell Armstrong.</span></p><p><span>Keep scrolling to know more about her loss.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Taylor Armstrong Ex-husband, Russell Armstrong, Left Her With A Daughter And $1.5 Million Debt</strong></span></h2><p><span>Back in the day, Taylor Armstrong, 50. was linked with Russell Armstrong. They tied the knot in October 2005, but unfortunately, their romance did not last long as Taylor opened about her relationship with Russell. In July 2011, Taylor announced that she <a href=# rel=noopener>filed a divorce</a> and also revealed for the first time the alleged abuse she had endured by her ex-husband, Russell.</span></p><p><span>The <span>5 feet 7.5 inches tall&nbsp;</span>star told host Andy Cohen and the other ladies of the show that she was quite often physically abused by Russell when she was pregnant with their daughter, Kennedy, even causing her to have reconstructive surgery close to her eye. The duo also got caught up in a <a href=# rel=noopener>$1.5 million lawsuit</a> with one of Russell’s business associates, medical company MMRGlobal over financial obligations relating to Russell at the time.</span></p><p><span>Unfortunately, Russell was found dead in August 2011 after <a href=# rel=noopener>committing suicide</a> by hanging at his Mulholland Drive house. It was a very tragic experience for Taylor amidst their divorce and other of their financial crisis. While an investigation was initiated for Russell’s death, his longtime attorney, Ronald Richards, told E! News, “He was always depressed,” and “always disappointed about the divorce and financial issues.”</span></p><p><span>But the mother-of-one was still left with the $1.5 million of debt – which was eventually settled with another heart-wrenching event – as far as forfeiting her wedding ring from her late estranged husband, Russell. Taylor said that she felt “like I’m going to be sick” while on a phone call with her lawyer, who asked for her <a href=# rel=noopener>wedding ring to settle debts</a>.</span></p><p><strong><span>EXPLORE:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Sutton Stracke On BravoTV's 'Real Housewives of Beverly Hills' - Net Worth, Husband, & Kids</a></span></strong></p><p><span>She even went on to say in a Bravo blog about the legal battle and added that the ring was one of the happy mementos Russell left behind, and Taylor was eventually planning to give it to their daughter Kennedy one day to wear. But she couldn’t handle the pressure from the attorneys as to, unfortunately, letting go of it.</span></p><p><span>Taylor has a daughter with her late ex-husband Russell named Kennedy. Last year, Taylor posted a new photo of her on Twitter on January 29 to wish her a birthday, writing, “She’s a big girl now #RHOBH birthday-best birthday party ever! my love Kennedy,” alongside a snap to the two as Kennedy turned 14 that year.</span></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>She’s a big girl now <a href=#>#RHOBH</a> birthday-best birthday party ever! my love Kennedy <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/bvChPbIprA</a></p>— Taylor Armstrong (@TaylorArmstrong) <a href=#>January 30, 2020</a><p><span>The TV star also gave a short update on her daughter in a video for BravoTV, saying that she’s been doing great.

Taylor further talked about how much her daughter has grown over the years and their sweet mother-daughter relationship in the video.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Taylor Armstrong Is Married To John Bluher</span></strong></h2><p><span>After experiencing a hard love life with her then-husband Russell Armstrong, Taylor Armstrong moved from the relationship and eventually ended up finding love again with a lawyer named John Bluher.</span></p><p><span>Taylor and John met through a mutual friend, and he apparently helped her with legal advice during the difficult time following her estranged husband’s death.
