To those who live in regions where the amphibious animals roam free, however, this is not an easy fact to forget — especially when these fearsome creatures attack.</p><p>Such was the case on December 4, when a two-year-old boy named Iga Paul was grabbed by a hippo while playing near his home. And, as <a href=# rel=noopener>People</a> reports, the hippo “swallowed half of his body” before spitting the child out.</p><p>Thankfully, the incident was witnessed by a bystander who sprung into action, lobbing stones at the hippo until it let the toddler go.</p><p>“It took the bravery of a one Chrispas Bagonza, who was nearby, to save the victim after he stoned the hippo and scared it, causing it to release the victim from its mouth,” police said.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-415908 alt="Iga Paul" width=800 height=800 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/child-survived-being-eaten-by-hippo.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-415908 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Facebook</span><span class=caption-body>Iga Paul was rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment and given a rabies vaccine as a precautionary measure, and has made a full recovery.</span></p><p>The child was rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment and given a rabies vaccine as a precautionary measure. According to police, the young boy made a full recovery and was discharged, returning home with his parents.</p><p>“Although the hippo was scared back into the lake, all residents near animal sanctuaries and habitats, should know that wild animals are very dangerous,” reads a <a href=# rel=noopener>police statement</a>. “Instinctually, wild animals see humans as a threat, and any interaction can cause them to act strangely or aggressively.”</p><p>However, police acknowledged that this was the first incident in which a hippo strayed from nearby Lake Edward, roughly half a mile away, and attacked a young child.</p><p>That said, it is hardly the first instance of a wild hippo attack. In fact, according to the BBC’s <a href=# rel=noopener>Wildlife</a> magazine, the hippopotamus is widely considered to be the deadliest large land animal on the planet, with an estimated 500 deaths per year in Africa attributed to the ferocious beasts.</p><p>Hippos are dangerous for a litany of reasons, but the chief contributors are their size, speed, and aggressive nature.</p><p>On average, they weigh around 3,300 pounds, but some have been known to weigh as much as 9,000. Despite this, they can easily outrun a human, reaching speeds of 30 miles per hour on land and 5 miles per hour in the water —&nbsp;more than twice the average swimming speed for humans.</p><p>And while hippos can’t breathe underwater, they can remain fully submerged for five minutes, meaning they aren’t always easy to detect until it’s too late.</p><p>Even seemingly domesticated <a href=# rel=noopener>hippos have turned on their owners</a>, proving once again that not all animals should be kept as pets.</p><p>The best course of action, then, would be to avoid wild hippos altogether, if you can. And if not, find somewhere to hide.</p><p>After reading about this terrifying run-in with nature, read about the grandmother who went missing — and then later <a href=#>found swallowed whole by a python</a>. Or, watch this <a href=#>video of a young hippo trying to play with a crocodile</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyptc%2Bppmarp5a5rbvWrGSun5GjsaK6jK2mnZycmr8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 WeBlogy - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
