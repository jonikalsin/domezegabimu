His paternal grandparents raised him and his elder sister, Bobbie, during the Great depression.</p><p class=dh>The "On the Road Again," hitmaker describes his grandparents as "loving" and "dedicated musical teachers." Nelson admits that they played a pivotal role in the music careers of him and his sister, by encouraging them to play and learn, even going as far as ordering musical books for them from Chicago.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/5bd5be74b07f640e83b3913c2197cda035360871573204321.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Willie Nelson speaks onstage at his album premiere. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Despite being surrounded by so much love, Nelson claims he always had the itch to look beyond the end of the road.</p><p class=dh>Nelson finally<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.biography.com/musician/willie-nelson> began to stray from his Christian upbringing</a>, and his emergence into the music scenery led to a notoriously promiscuous life that resulted in three failed marriages, battle with alcohol abuse, and most painfully, the loss of a son.</p><p class=dh>Nelson was able to miraculously turn things around with his marriage to his fourth wife, Annie D'Angelo. The couple got married in 1991 and shared two children, Lukas and Micah, who are also musicians. Speaking about his marriage to D'Angelo, the country <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.biography.com/musician/willie-nelson>music legend wrote:</a></p><p class=dh>"It's love that brought Annie and me together, and it's love that, nearly 30 years later, has kept us together."</p><p class=dh>The couple met when D'Angelo was hired to work as a makeup artist on the set of the 1986 movie "Stagecoach," which starred Nelson. After dating for several years, they eventually tied the knot on September 16, 1991, at Nashville's St. Alouin Church, in front of family and friends.</p><p class=dh>Willie Nelson's wife Annie has been <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://heavy.com/entertainment/2020/04/annie-dangelo-willie-nelson-wife/>instrumental to the star's new</a> stable lifestyle, having stuck by her husband through several drug arrests and charges over the years.</p><p class=dh>The couple shares a unique bond, and Nelson, who admits that he is a difficult person to live with, says it takes someone special to live with him.</p><p class=dh>The couple genuinely has an exceptional understanding.
